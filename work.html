            Selected for the University of Michigan’s award-winning Development Summer Internship Program (D-SIP) as a Dobson Intern at The Women's Center of Southeastern Michigan, an Ann Arbor mental health and empowerment oriented nonprofit. During my 3 month stay with The Women's Center, I worked to  deversify and streamline the donor experience. In doing so, I assessed current revenue generation methods, completed website analysis, implemented data analytic strategies, and evaluated donor platforms , presenting and adopting propositions to the nonprofit's board of directors. Additionally, I  orchestrated a 5-day virtual walking campaign, exceeding individual contributions goals by 60% and successfully soliciting over $1,000 in product donations from local business partners.
